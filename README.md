🎓 Final Year Project: Hama Bead Pattern Validator
This project is a mobile application that analyzes and validates Hama bead patterns created by users. The aim is to check the accuracy of the designs through image processing techniques and provide feedback.

📋 About the Project
Purpose: To analyze Hama bead patterns and validate their correctness.
Technology: Built using Flutter for mobile development; image processing will be implemented using OpenCV in the future.
Status: Currently in the initial development phase, focusing on building the app structure.

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

Flutter - Mobile app development framework.
Dart - Programming language for Flutter.
OpenCV - For image processing (planned for later stages).
Git & GitHub - Version control and collaboration.

🚀 Features
Current Goals:
📷 Pattern Scanning
Allow users to scan Hama bead patterns using their device's camera.

✅ Pattern Validation
Analyze the design for errors, such as missing or misplaced beads.

📊 Reporting
Provide users with feedback on the accuracy of their patterns.


## 🌱 Future Plans
Implement error detection for misplaced beads.
Calculate an accuracy percentage for each design.
Develop a user-friendly feedback report.
Add multi-platform support (iOS and Android).
